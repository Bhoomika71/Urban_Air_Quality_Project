Predictive Analytics & Driver Analysis for Urban Air Quality in India
Problem Statement

Air pollution is a critical public health concern in India, affecting millions every year. Rapid urbanization, industrial activities, and vehicular emissions contribute to fluctuating air quality levels in cities. While monitoring pollution levels is important, predicting future air quality and identifying the key drivers behind pollution spikes can help authorities, policymakers, and businesses take proactive measures.

The goal of this project is to develop a data-driven framework to predict air quality (PM2.5 levels) for major Indian cities and analyze the factors that contribute most to pollution events. The project integrates historical air quality data with potential influencing factors, performs exploratory data analysis, and builds predictive models using machine learning. Insights will later be communicated via an interactive dashboard to support actionable decision-making.


ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
Time Series Air Quality Data of India (2010â€“2023)

Source: Central Control Room for Air Quality Management

Cities covered: 453+

Time period: 2010 â€“ 2023

Format: CSV files (per monitoring station)

Since this project is implemented on Kaggle Notebooks, the dataset is accessed directly from Kaggleâ€™s input/ directory and is not uploaded to this repository.
